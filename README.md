# Random-Forest-classifier
I applied a Random Forest classifier to the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival. After cleaning and encoding categorical features like Deck, Embarked, and Ticket using one-hot encoding, I split the data into training and testing sets. The model was trained on the training data and evaluated on the test set using accuracy as the metric.
